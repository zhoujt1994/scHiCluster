# Tan et al. Cell 2021.

The authors studied the developing mouse cortex and hippocampus by profiling gene expression of 3517 cells with MALBAC-DT and 3D genome structure of 3646 cells with DipC. Here we demonstrate the analyses of 3D genome features across these cells, including 
- Clustering of DipC cells using chromatin contacts
- Annotation of DipC cells to RNA clusters
- Loop calling of cell types

The chromatin contact data can be downloaded from GSE146397 and GSE164203 for all the .contacts.pairs.txt.gz files.
